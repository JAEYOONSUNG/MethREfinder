\title{Match enzyme sequences with target sequence}
\usage{
match_enzyme_sequences(mod_type, target_seq)
}
\arguments{
\item{mod_type}{Character string (e.g., "4mC", "5mC", "6mA").}

\item{target_seq}{Character string (target DNA sequence).}
}
\value{
Data frame with matched enzyme sequences.
}
\description{
Matches enzymes against a target sequence using both FORWARD and BACKWARD overlap.
\itemize{
\item FORWARD: window_suffix + RecSeq_prefix (RecSeq extends after window)
\item BACKWARD: RecSeq_suffix + window_prefix (RecSeq extends before window)
}
}
